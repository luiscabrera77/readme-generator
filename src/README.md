## Description
![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

Allows user to quickly create a README file for Github using terminal prompts. It starts by asking GitHub username, email address, and contact preferences, and then asks the following details about the project: Name, Description, Installation Instructions, Usage Instructions, License, Contributing Guidelines and Testing. The output is a professionally formatted README file in markup with a table of contents, links, badges, full license texts, and contact information.
